# JavaScript Arithmetic Error

This repository demonstrates a simple arithmetic error in two JavaScript functions. The `foo` function is supposed to add two numbers, and the `bar` function is supposed to subtract two numbers. However, both functions contain errors in their calculations.  The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, and the `bugSolution.js` file contains the corrected code.
